# TEAM_ACF-workflow
Github workflow activity

While making this repository we learned:
* That .gitignore is optional but often used.
* It's hard(er) to make a repo from the command line.

While Cloning the Repo, 
* We learned that we need to clone with HTTPS and not SSH
* We learned that remote repositories are version that exist online
* Upstream means that it has new changes that I haven't pulled on to my local files

While making new issues we learned:
* how to create a new issue on Github.
* what information is expected to be given when opening an issue on a project.

When making a branch to fix issues:
* We learned how to navigate branches
* How to merge branches into master
* How to delete branches after an issue/pr is fixed.
